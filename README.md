# Learning FPGA 
## Description of works
1.  *(First_in_course and Blink)*. Main goal is t0 build a simple logic by using primitives as __and__ __or__ __not__ blocks. 
2.  *(Prime_number)*. Main goal is by using previous blocks create a detector of simple numbers. Map of Karno was done. 
3.  *(Third_les)*. Goal of this work is to create D-trigger by using simple logic primitives. (RS-trigger, D-latch).
4.  *(Fourth_les)*. Creating a 4-bit summator by using Verilog. Testbenches were added.
5.  *(Fifth_les)*. 4-bit counter was created that can count up and down. Decoder for seven segments indicator was made. Range_analyzer that can indicate at which level an input number sets.
6.  *(Sixth_les)*. Decoder and counter were combined in this work.
7.  *(Seventh_les)*. Machine state work was done. There are some sequence code which must be set without interrupting.
